<h1>My Favorite Books:</h1>

<h2>Percy Jackson Series</h2>
<p>This was one of the first books that I had ever read. I loved the way the book was filled with action and adventure. It was great how each character
  had their own story to tell. That is most likely why this series is in my favorites list.</p>

<h2>Hunger Games Series</h2>
<p>The Hunger Games books are probably the books I have read the most. Every couple of years, I like to reread the series. So far I have read all 
  three books 7 times. I love the way I could and understand what the character was feeling even though it had a plot so far from my life. </p>

<h2>Harry Potter Series and Movies</h2>
<p>Even though many tend to like the Movies better than the Series, I will always like both of them the same. I loved getting the chance to read the books 
and create a world of my own. But I also loved seeing what I had imagined while reading come to life.</p>
