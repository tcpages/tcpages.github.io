											<p>About Me</p>
										</header>
<font size="4"><font size="3">							    <p>My name is Tia and I live in Minnesota. I am currently in high school and ready for my next summer vacation. When I am asked the question of what my favorite subject in school is I always reply with Math. Most people would think that English would be in at least my top 3 since I am such a bookworm. Except reading is not my only hobby. I also enjoy painting, coding, and watching Marvel movies. I could name any fact or quote from the movies. It is one of my many superpowers. My other would probably include playing games and even creating them. This should come as no surprise considering my hobby includes coding. I love to code and being able to create things is very exciting for me.</p></font></font>
