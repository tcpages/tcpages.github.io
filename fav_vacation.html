<h1> My Favorite Vacations:</h1>
  
<h2>Cancun, Mexico</h2>
<p>One of my favorite vacations was when my family and I had taken a trip to Cancun, Mexico. It was a lot of fun being able relax at the beach all day
with my family. We were able to just sit around all day without having to worry about anything. I remember getting to order food and have it brought to me
outside. I had the best time during this vacation.</p>

<h2>Disney World</h2>
<p>Another one of my favorite vacations was when I had gone to Disney World. Being one of the biggest Disney fans in the world, it was a great experience
all of the movies I watched at home come to life. At the park, I went on every ride in my sight. I even bought some souvenirs that I will keep with me 
forever.</p>
