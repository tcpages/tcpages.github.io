<h1>My Hobbies:</h1>

<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>As you can probably tell, I love to code. Over the past few years I have learned a lot about coding. This includes how to make websites, games, and
even apps. I am even fluent in four coding languages. So it comes as no suprise since this is what I with most of my free time.</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>I love to read! Whenever I have sometime to myself, I usually get a book and start reading. Although I am open to reading a wide variety of books,
I do have some favorites. This includes Percy Jackson, Hunger Games, and of course, Harry Potter.</p>

<h2>Watching Movies</h2>
<p>Even though I like to read, I also enjoy watching tv. My favorite things to watch are Marvel Movies. I have kept up with these movies as long as I can 
remember. Anytime there is something new coming out, I will always be there to watch it.</p>

<h2>Drawing and Painting</h2>
<p>Although I don't consider myself good at drawing or painting, it is something that I enjoy. I had taken a class at my school and learned how fun it is
to make something with just a piece of paper and a pencil. Below you can find a link to pictures of my artwork.</p>
